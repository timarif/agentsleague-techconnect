## 🎯 Winning Strategy Tips

### Balance All Three Dimensions
Don't just focus on technical complexity. A simple but highly valuable solution with great UX can beat a technically sophisticated but impractical one.

### Quality Over Quantity
It's better to do one thing exceptionally well than five things poorly. Nail your core use case first.

### Show, Don't Tell
Your demo should speak for itself. Let judges experience the value rather than just hearing about it.

### Know Your Users
The best solutions come from deep empathy with the people who have the problem. Talk to them early and often.

### Think Production-Ready
Even in a hackathon, show you're thinking about security, scalability, and real-world deployment.
## ❓ FAQ

### Can I use vibe-coding?

**Yes!** You are welcome to use vibe-coding approaches and AI-assisted development tools to build your solution. Leveraging AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot to accelerate your development is encouraged.

### Can I use community and open source libraries/SDKs?

**Yes!** You can use community-contributed and open source libraries, SDKs, and frameworks in your solution. Open source tools are a great way to accelerate development and leverage the collective work of the developer community.

### Can I use commercial/proprietary libraries/SDKs?

**No.** The use of commercial or proprietary libraries and SDKs that require paid licenses or are not freely available is not permitted. Your solution should be built using open source or freely available tools to ensure accessibility and reproducibility.

### Can I share a real project that I've been working on for my company or for a customer?

**No.** You cannot submit existing projects that were developed for your company or for customers. All submissions must be original work created specifically for this hackathon. This ensures a fair competition and protects any confidential or proprietary information.

### Do I need to use my own tenant?

**Yes.** Candidates are expected to use their own Microsoft 365 tenant for development and testing. We recommend using a dedicated developer tenant to avoid impacting production environments. For detailed information on setting up a Copilot development environment, please refer to the [Microsoft 365 Copilot extensibility prerequisites](https://aka.ms/extend-Copilot-sandbox).

### Is the MCP server integration really optional?
**Yes,** but teams that include it (especially with read/write capabilities) will score significantly higher on technical implementation. It's worth the effort!

### What if we have great business value but simpler technical implementation?
**That's completely fine!** Each dimension is weighted equally. A highly valuable, well-designed solution with solid (not fancy) tech can definitely win.

### Can we score points in Connected Agents without MCP servers?
**Yes!** You could build connected agents that work together within the Copilot ecosystem, even without external integrations.

### Should we build for breadth or depth?
**Depth.** Do one thing incredibly well. It's better to solve one problem end-to-end than to half-solve three problems.
